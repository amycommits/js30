    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // with Objects

    // and think we make a copy:

    console.table({person, captain})
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    // empty, object, new/overwrite
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, {num: 99})
    console.table({person, captain2})
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const captn = {...person}
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
